****SQL aggregate functions are used to perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value. 
They are commonly used in conjunction with the GROUP BY clause to summarize data.**** 
Below is a brief overview of the most commonly used aggregate functions in SQL:

1.COUNT()
  Purpose: Returns the number of rows that match a specified condition.
    Usage:
    COUNT(*): Counts all rows, including duplicates and NULLs.
    COUNT(column_name): Counts non-NULL values in the specified column.
    COUNT(DISTINCT column_name): Counts unique non-NULL values in the specified column.
    Example:
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalEmployees FROM Employees; -- Counts all employees

2.SUM()
  Purpose: Returns the total sum of a numeric column.
    Usage: Only works on numeric data types and ignores NULL values.
    Example:
    SELECT SUM(Salary) AS TotalSalary FROM Employees; -- Calculates total salary

3.AVG()
  Purpose: Returns the average value of a numeric column.
    Usage: Ignores NULL values in the calculation.
    Example:
    SELECT AVG(Salary) AS AverageSalary FROM Employees; -- Calculates average salary

4.MIN()
  Purpose: Returns the smallest value in a specified column.
    Usage: Works with numeric, string, and date data types, ignoring NULL values.
    Example:
    SELECT MIN(Salary) AS LowestSalary FROM Employees; -- Finds the lowest salary

5.MAX()
  Purpose: Returns the largest value in a specified column.
    Usage: Similar to MIN(), it ignores NULL values.
    Example:
    SELECT MAX(Salary) AS HighestSalary FROM Employees; -- Finds the highest salary
