-----The error message , Error Code: 1175, indicates that you are currently in safe update mode in MySQL. This mode is designed to prevent accidental updates or deletions of data in your database.-----

1.Purpose:
  Safe update mode is a feature in MySQL that restricts certain operations (specifically UPDATE and DELETE) to prevent unintentional changes to a large number of rows.
  It requires that any update or delete operation includes a WHERE clause that uses a key column (typically a primary key or indexed column).

----Solutions to Fix Error Code 1175----
Here are several methods to resolve this error:
1.Disable Safe Update Mode Temporarily:
  You can disable safe update mode for your current session by executing the following SQL command:
  sql-:
  SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;

After running this command, you can execute your UPDATE statement without restrictions.

2.Re-enable Safe Update Mode:
  If you want to be cautious and re-enable safe update mode after performing your updates, you can do so with:
  sql-:
  SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 1;

3.Disable Safe Updates Permanently:
  ->If you want to disable safe update mode permanently (not recommended unless you're sure), you can do it through the MySQL Workbench interface:
    Go to Edit -> Preferences.
    Click on the SQL Editor tab.
    Uncheck the option for "Safe Updates".
    Click OK and reconnect to the server.

4.Using Key Columns in WHERE Clause:
  Instead of disabling safe update mode, consider modifying your query to include a key column in the WHERE clause. 
  This way, you can keep safe updates enabled while ensuring that your queries execute successfully.
