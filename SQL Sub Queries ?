***A Sub Queries or Inner Qeries or  a Nested Query is a query within another SQL query.***
--->It usually involves 2 Select Statements [can be more than 2 also .]

Syntax -:
    Select column(s)
    from tableA
    where column_name opertor
    (Subquery);


Example-:
    Select name
    from student_table
    where marks>=(select Avg(marks) from student_table);

This query will filter out only the names of students who have scored more than the average class marks. Here the result of the outer query depends on the result of the inner query.
