*****In SQL, clauses are components of statements that specify conditions, operations, and filters to manipulate and retrieve data from a database. 
Each clause serves a specific purpose and helps in constructing effective queries.*****

1.SELECT Clause
    Purpose: Used to specify the columns that you want to retrieve from a database table.
    Syntax:
    SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;
    
    Example:
    SELECT name, age FROM employees;
2.FROM Clause
    Purpose: Indicates the table from which to retrieve the data.
    Syntax:
    SELECT column1 FROM table_name;
    
    Example:
    SELECT * FROM customers;
3.WHERE Clause
    Purpose: Filters records based on specified conditions. It can be used with SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements.
    Syntax:
    SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition;
    
    Example:
    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;
4.ORDER BY Clause
    Purpose: Sorts the result set in ascending or descending order based on one or more columns.
    Syntax:
    SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC];
    
    Example:
    SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY price DESC;
5. LIMIT Clause
    Purpose: Specifies the maximum number of records to return from a result set.
    Syntax:
    SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT number;
    
    Example:
    SELECT * FROM employees LIMIT 10;
6. GROUP BY Clause
    Purpose: Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows, often used with aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.
    Syntax:
    SELECT column1, COUNT(*) FROM table_name GROUP BY column1;
    
    Example:
    SELECT department, COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY department;

7. HAVING Clause
    Purpose: Filters records after aggregation has been performed by the GROUP BY clause. It is similar to the WHERE clause but is used for aggregated data.
    Syntax:
    SELECT column1, SUM(column2) FROM table_name GROUP BY column1 HAVING SUM(column2) > value;
    
    Example:
    SELECT department, SUM(salary) AS TotalSalary FROM employees GROUP BY department HAVING SUM(salary) > 100000;

8. DISTINCT Clause
    Purpose: Removes duplicate rows from the result set.
    Syntax:
    
    SELECT DISTINCT column1 FROM table_name;
    
    Example:
    
    SELECT DISTINCT country FROM customers;
9. UNION and UNION ALL
    Purpose: Combines the result sets of two or more SELECT statements.
    UNION: Removes duplicate records.
    UNION ALL: Includes all records, including duplicates.
    Syntax:
    SELECT column1 FROM table1
    UNION
    SELECT column1 FROM table2;
    
    Example:
    SELECT city FROM customers
    UNION
    SELECT city FROM suppliers;

10. JOIN Clause
    Purpose: Combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.
    Types of Joins:
    INNER JOIN: Returns records with matching values in both tables.
    LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN): Returns all records from the left table and matched records from the right table.
    RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN): Returns all records from the right table and matches records from the left table.
    FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN): Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table records.
    Example of INNER JOIN:
    SELECT employees. name, departments.name 
    FROM employees 
    INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
