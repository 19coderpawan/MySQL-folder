Data types specify what type of value your field/column is holding. There are various data types in SQL -:

1. Numeric Data Types
    .Used to store numeric values.
->Common types include:
  .INT: Standard integer type.
  .TINYINT: Very small integer (typically 1 byte).
  .SMALLINT: Small integer (typically 2 bytes).
  .BIGINT: Large integer (typically 8 bytes).
  .DECIMAL(p,s): Fixed-point number with precision p and scale s.
  .FLOAT: Floating-point number, approximate numeric.
  .REAL: Similar to FLOAT but with less precision.

2. Character String Data Types
    .Used to store alphanumeric characters.
->Common types include:
  .CHAR(n): Fixed-length string, padded with spaces if necessary.
  .VARCHAR(n): Variable-length string, up to n characters.
  .TEXT: Large variable-length string for larger text data.

3. Unicode Character String Data Types
    .Similar to character string types but designed to support international characters.
->Common types include:
   .NCHAR(n): Fixed-length Unicode string.
   .NVARCHAR(n): Variable-length Unicode string.
   .NTEXT: Large variable-length Unicode text.

    IsActive BOOLEAN
);

4. Binary Data Types
   .Used to store binary data (e.g., images, files).
->Common types include:
   .BINARY(n): Fixed-length binary data.
   .VARBINARY(n): Variable-length binary data.
   .BLOB: Binary Large Object for storing large binary data

5. Date and Time Data Types
    .Used to store date and time information.
->Common types include:
   .DATE: Stores date in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
   .TIME: Stores time in the format HH:MM:SS.

    .ENUM: A string object with a value chosen from a list of permitted values.
    .SET: A string object that can have zero or more values, each of which must be chosen from a list of permitted values.
    .CLOB: Character large object used to store large text data.
    .XML: Used to store XML documents.
    .JSON: Used to store JSON formatted data.
